[BOSS1]

Who the fuck is this guy? That's right, it's a boss! Beat this guy up, and
you'll get one of the 5 Thug Shaker Shards! Who is this guy, exactly? Oh, it's
just a 1.5* larger and 148.8* health-having Pistol Tard, with Additive rendering.
Tard Ghost, basically. Go figure -- This is all done in UDMF mapping trickery!

[BOSS2]

Liquid Chubbs. Yeah. We're stealing from Metal Gear with this one.

[BOSS3]

Hey, look, over there, it's... Who the fuck is calling it 'Terry'? That's the
head of Carnevil, the developer of Skulltag... Jeez, some people are idiots.
And look over there, too... That's supposed to be Kronik!

[BOSS4]

Close your eyes, shut your mouth, plug your ears, spray and pray. We're gonna
bust your balls to an extent not observed by man in history. It's Gangsta Grosse,
and he's already noticed you lookin' at him, bizz-naaaaaatch...!

[BOSS5]

It's... IT'S... WOW! Haha! You THOUGHT this was Epstein!? This is just an AI
generated clone of the reanimated corpse of Jeffery Epstein, not the reanimated
corpse of Jeffery Epstein! You can tell the difference thanks to the 6 fingers
he has!

[FINALE]

Focus on nothing else but killing that motherfucker Epstein. Save our helpless
kids.
